When using the Raspberry Pi you have a choice to use USB cameras or RasPi Cameras.
The Raspberry Pi Cameras are much faster due to a different hardware bus and better integartion. THey can also be better controlled for exposure, image size, etc.
There are two versions of the Camera for the Pi, the standard one and the infrared version, RaspCam Noir. If possible use the Noir since it's better with low light conditions. The RasPi Camera also has 5 MP resolution.
When buying the RaspCam make sure to also source a longer ribbon cable. Use at least 50cm. Those are available at Adafruit or Aliexpress. There are also ways to use an adapter for HDMI cable or solder your own.
