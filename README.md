# firepick.github.io
Project Website

This is the repository for the http://firepick.github.io website. It can be used for http://www.firepick.org once it adds some value. The 'master' branch will be rendered as a website.

Other repositories can act as sub-pages, in that case 'gh-pages' branch will be rendered as a page.
For example https://github.com/firepick/documentation is accessible as http://firepick.github.io/documentation as long as it has an index.html file in the gh-pages branch.
